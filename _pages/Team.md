### **Principal Investigator**

**Thang T. Dang** *Founder & Lead Architect*

Thang T. Dang is the driving force behind the Independent Drug Discovery (IDD) Lab. Currently completing his undergraduate studies at the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), his work focuses on the intersection of generative artificial intelligence, quantum-classical computational biophysics, and structural biology.

Operating outside traditional faculty structures, he founded IDD Lab to establish an agile, modality-agnostic computational core. His primary research objective is to develop end-to-end therapeutic architectures—transitioning isolated chemical discoveries into mechanistically validated clinical candidates.

#### **Intellectual Property & Systems Architecture**
Beyond chemical biology, Thang is an active inventor in the software engineering and generative AI sectors. 
* **Provisional Patent (USPTO Pending):** Inventor of the "Attention-for-Compute" (A4C) Protocol. This protocol details a secure, asynchronous execution architecture for generative AI environments. The system employs zero-knowledge proof proxies and strict "Air-Gap" process isolation (via Web Workers and sandboxed origins) to synchronize parallel network operations, ensuring that highly sensitive user prompt data is never leaked to third-party DOMs.

#### **Modality-Agnostic Therapeutics**
While the lab's foundational pipelines focus on small-molecule optimization, IDD Lab's computational infrastructure is fundamentally modality-agnostic. Current exploratory frameworks are actively expanding beyond small molecules to encompass the *in silico* design of protein-based therapeutics, monoclonal antibodies, targeted immunology, and genetic-based therapeutics.

#### **Chemical Viability & Synthesis Integration**
Computational designs are only as valuable as their physical synthesis. To ensure IDD Lab's *de novo* generated molecules are chemically viable, Thang maintains a strong foundation in synthetic organic chemistry, previously placing in the Top 20% of the Vietnam Organic Synthesis Challenge.

### **Join the Lab (Spring Term Recruitment)**

IDD Lab is actively recruiting highly driven, self-directed undergraduate researchers to join our computational core. We do not require prior experience in Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD), but we demand rigorous work ethics, analytical thinking, and a willingness to master complex bioinformatic pipelines.

Lab members will receive direct training in molecular dynamics, docking, rational lead optimization, and other CADD techniques, with opportunities for co-authorship on Q1/Q2 journal submissions.

**Open Roles:**
* Computational Chemistry Trainee
* Bioinformatics Data Analyst
