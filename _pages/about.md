**Principal Investigator:** Thang T. Dang

The **Independent Drug Discovery Lab (IDD Lab)** is an integrated computational research initiative operating at the intersection of **End-to-End Drug Design**, **Therapeutic Bioinformatics**, and **Chemical Biology**. We bridge the critical gap between isolated chemical extraction and actionable biological mechanisms.

**Beyond Standard Prediction**
The modern pharmaceutical landscape is constrained by segmented pipelines and a reliance on rigid structural dogmas. IDD Lab operates on a different paradigm. We do not merely predict binding affinities or run isolated simulations; we architect comprehensive therapeutic workflows.

Operating outside the constraints of legacy institutional red tape, the lab is an agile, modality-agnostic think-tank. Our mission is to accelerate the Design-Make-Test-Analyze (DMTA) cycle by deploying advanced Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD), from identifying the targets of uncharacterized natural products to the de novo hallucination of novel inhibitors.

**Our Scientific Focus**
1. **Target Deconvolution & Network Pharmacology:** Transforming isolated cytotoxic compounds into mechanistically validated therapeutics through proprietary reverse-docking and protein-protein interaction (PPI) mapping.
2. **Generative Therapeutics & Rational Design:** Utilizing structure-based genetic algorithms and molecular dynamics to engineer highly selective small-molecule inhibitors from the ground up.
3. **Lead Optimization & Polypharmacology:** Refining molecular profiles for superior ADME characteristics, enhanced on-target selectivity, and engineered dual-action modulation.
4. **Frontier Structural Biology:** Developing theoretical frameworks to address the "Dark Proteome," shifting the paradigm from static structural biology toward ensemble-based drug design for intrinsically disordered targets.

**Unencumbered Collaboration**
IDD Lab actively partners with global wet-lab investigators, synthetic organic chemists, and pharmacognosy research groups. We provide the computational resolution necessary to elevate standard extraction and synthesis reports into high-impact, mechanism-driven publications.

As we operate independently, we offer highly flexible, co-authorship-driven collaborations without the friction of traditional institutional bureaucracy.
